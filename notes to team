10/16: modify.php in authors works

10/16: Another late night comment...not sure you all have noticed this...
Quotes can be added to csv with unique quoteID, authorID, quoteText structure
Add author FINALLY doesn't accept duplicate entries (unless you spell it wrong).
authors/index and create are 100% functional, just need to be prettier
authors/details works, but the display does not include quotes by that author yet.
quotes/create is functional for adding quotes to the database and "checking" for dups
        need to add functionality to redirect user after quote is entered...
	...	not sure where to send them - author details updated with quote, quote-specific detail page?
We now have relational keys for the data in the files. This should help us
with the delete function. Although, the numbering on the new items after a deletion
might get wonky. I should have sqared or cubed the base number instead of last line + 1

I hate to take a break given how much is still left to do, but I've got to sleep.



10/15/22: Didn't want to put this in Teams and wake anyone up...

If you look at authors/createv2.php, I edited the code a little to create a unique ID for each new author that persists when we delete lines (since deleting in this project is overwriting with an empty line). I was having trouble after deletions with the modify and view links pointing to the wrong line. I did not overwrite Amaya's code, because I did not test if her code experienced the same misalignment after deleting. This is something I started working on the other day and wanted to test. It points to a different csv file for now.
